#### What is an "agent"?

An agent is an AI being that shares the same space as users, interacting, speaking, and experiencing the world. They can be used for simple companionship or training and gameplay opportunities. Vircadia excels at the deployment of agents en-masse to allow in a full sandbox experience.
